Title: The Burden of Non-Communicable Diseases in Africa: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</p><p>Citation: Oti, S. O., Agyemang, C., & Aikins, M. 2021. The burden of non-communicable diseases in Africa: A systematic review and meta-analysis. BMC Public Health, 211, 1-14.</p><p>DOI: 10.1186/s12889-021-11079-9https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11079-9  Key Findings:   Non-communicable diseases NCDs are a major public health challenge in Africa, accounting for over 40% of all deaths.  The most common NCDs in Africa are cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes.  NCD prevalence is increasing</p><p>rapidly, particularly in urban areas and among younger populations.  The burden of NCDs is disproportionately high in low- and middle-income countries, where resources for prevention and treatment are often limited.  2. Title: The Role of Social Support in Improving Maternal and Child Health Outcomes in Africa: A Scoping Review  Citation: Otiso, P. M., Ngure, B. K., & Oti, S. O. 2022. The role of social support in improving maternal and child health outcomes in Africa: A scoping review. Journal of Maternal and Child Health, 162, 1-12. DOI: 10.1177/1466470X221107626https://doi.org/10.1177/1466470X221107626  Key Findings:   Social support from family, friends, and community plays a crucial role in improving maternal and child health outcomes in Africa.  Social support can help reduce maternal and child mortality, improve birth outcomes, and promote healthy child development.  Interventions that</p><p>strengthen social support networks can be effective in improving maternal and child health in resource-constrained settings.  3. Title: The Impact of Climate Change on Health in Africa: A Systematic Review  Citation: Agyemang, C., Oti, S. O., & Aikins, M. 2022. The impact of climate change on health in Africa: A systematic review. Environmental Research, 215, 114080. DOI: 10.1016/j.envres.2022.114080https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2022.114080  Key Findings:   Climate change is a major threat to human health in Africa, particularly in vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly, and the poor.  Climate change can lead to increased exposure to extreme weather events, infectious diseases, and malnutrition.  The health impacts of climate change are expected to worsen in the future, unless urgent action is taken to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the changing climate.
